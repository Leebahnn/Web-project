    <h1 class="Txtedit cornerimage">Review your website</h1>

    <div class="textstyle"><h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>

    <p class="Fontx">

        I'm pretty happy with the website as it showcases what we have learned over the past couple of weeks, so even the use of the programs were decided beforehand as those are the tools we learned to create with.

</p>
    
<div class="textstyle"><h2>2.2 Describe if the tools used were appropriate for the creation of my website</h2>

    <p class="Fontx">

        
        For the creation of my website these tools were more than appropriate as they are powerfull tools, and also common tools that even more professionnal web developers use.

    </p>

    <div class="textstyle"><h2>2.3 Assessing strengths and weaknesses of my web project</h2>

        <p class="Fontx">

            I would have wanted to get a bit more time to create the website as it would allow us to delve into it a bit more in the creation process.
            Because I think that the website is visually dull and I also would want more interactivity with javascript.
            At the end the website is pretty straightforward with the information necessary, but I will try to improve it with new knowledge and more time.

        </p>

        <div class="textstyle"><h2>2.4 Describing further improvements for the project</h2>

            <p class="Fontx">

                I would love to redesign the mainpage as an index for the website so that I can have a front page that will link to the main page.
                Also insert interactive simple 8 bit games with javascript so that it can follow the harmony of the website that is based on old-school videogames.
            </p>


            <div class="textstyle"><h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>

                <p class="Fontx">

                    I created a platform to write about me and respond to all the questions that were in the assignment so I can say that the requirements were matched.
                    And the project is fit to showcase the skills that I have learned over these past few weeks.

                <div class="textstyle"><h2>What adding copyright means</h2>

                    <p class="Fontx">

                        Copyright is a law that protects your website from being reproduced.
                        That means your graphics, content, visual elements are copyrighted from the development of your website, as it is published work.

                        </p>

                        <div class="textstyle"><h2>Why do we accept cookies and what are they ? And how do they relate to GDPR ? </h2>

                            <p class="Fontx">

                                We accept cookies because it allows to have information stocked,like Geographic location or customized ad banners, for when we comeback on the website.
                                After accepting you are allowing the website to stock a file on your pc or laptop or phone so that we have a better user experience of the website and we can use it more conveniently.
                                It is related to GDPR as it remembers things we do on a website so it is our personal data, GDPR protects our data so that's why we are asked to accept cookies when we enter a new website as they have to mention it now.
