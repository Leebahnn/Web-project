             We should understand what your needs are and the market you are targeting, and create a plan accordingly with the information obtained.
             After understanding the project we can set the purpose and goals of your website and create a clear budget for it. <br> At the same time it allows us to identify which tools to use for realization of the project.
             We can also start creating a content strategy which is extremely important for your customers, and start structuring your website before the design work.

            The planning of the project will be mainly done in Trello at the moment, it allows us also to do collaborative work in a way that's easier.<br>
            And we understand clearly what needs to be done and can divide the work into groups who will finish different tasks .

            <h2>1.4 The different risks that might impact your project :</h2>
             <p class="Fontx">  <br>
            Once your project is launched, you need to think of it as an ongoing project that represents the image of your business.<br>
            So it is important to analyse and understand the different risks at the creation of your project to plan ahead of the problematics you may encounter, and so that you will have a finished product that serves you in the long term.
            As any other web based projects it needs maintenance to keep your site upto to date, and the best way to do that is to have someone to monitor your project from the launch and to it's entirety.

            <h2>1.5 Selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
             <p class="Fontx"> <br>
            At first we need to know the scale of the project we are working on, so that we can choose the right tech stack.<br>
            A tech stack is the combination of programming languages, tools and frameworks, which is then divided in two software components called front-end(client-side) and back-end(server-side).<br>
            When we know the scale of our project whether it's a small one,like an artist's website to put his work out and where it needs to be delivered as soon as possible we can use Wordpress.<br>
            Or a big project, like an e-commerce or a databased website where we need a mixture of programming languages(Javascript,CSS,Python,HTML) and web apps (Java,C#).<br>
            We should also see how big the community is behind the language or framework and see if the interest of the software is still growing.
            Because there is no point of choosing something old if there is something new better, faster and more responsive.<br>
            But your projects always determines choosing the right stack as we can easily get lost with all the different tools available in today's world.

            I used Javascript, HTML and CSS to create this website.<br>
            Because it's the tools that I'm the most familiar with at the moment so it allows me to be better at my work using tools I know.<br> 
            Instead of integrating other software that I'm unfamiliar with.
